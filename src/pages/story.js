        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Mad Beatz Philly began in 2013 as an all-star collective of upperclassmen and alumni under the direction of
            their public school music teacher, Jesse Mell. Through the development of a unique curriculum and system of
            independent study, we founded the art of “DJ Drumline” in Philadelphia - performing live to Pop, Hiphop and
            EDM tracks at a moment’s notice! We quickly became a sensation around town, performing in concert lots,
            colleges, and public schools.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since then, we’ve grown into a destination for grind-minded young professionals. We have been featured at
            Diner En Blanc, the Fillmore, and Frankford Hall for our unique specialty - DJ Drumline - as well as
            educational workshops and assemblies at the Mann Music Center for our “Cultural Connections” series!

            internships to percussionists ages 16-18.
